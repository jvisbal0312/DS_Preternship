**Project Introduction**
> The objective of this project is to build a GUI to simulate waveforms based on user-specified inputs over time. The user would be able to input 2 or 3 variables and the boolean operations they wish to perform on the variables. The GUI would take the input, perform the boolean operations, and output an animation of the waveforms in real time. Each variable will be a different color so it will be easier for the user to track each variable throughout its waveform. This GUI will include a component of animation which models the behavior of Boolean algebra and tools, such as K-maps, adders, decoders, multiplexers, etc. It could potentially help hardware engineers to address the problem of staring at a static screen for long periods of time.
